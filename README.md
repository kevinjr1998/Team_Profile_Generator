# Team_Profile_Generator

## Task

This project involved using object orienter programming to create a project that would generate a team profile webpage. This involved using a base class called employee that would use constructors for name, id and email and methods to return role, name, id and email, then extending this class into different types of employees, using as manager, engineer and intern, also with relevant constructors and methods. Inquirer was used for the promts for the user to enter information about the employees and generate the webpage using this info. Whenever a new employee was created, a new instance of the relevant employee class is created and the info written to it using Inquirer is the passed to the template helper function to generate the webpage. To test that the classes created work as intended, Jest was used to write and run tests.
